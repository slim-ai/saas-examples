# Webgems

Original source of this example is from github repository [lostdesign/webgems](https://github.com/lostdesign/webgems).
This example is Nuxt.js Serverside rendering application listening on port 5000.
In this example we use minification using flag `--include-app-nuxt-static-dir` which includes files required by nuxt.js to work. During minification many files are removed which results in difference of 298,4 MB between big and unoptimized image.
